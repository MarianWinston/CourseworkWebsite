            <h1>Mitigating corporate information exposure on the web</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>According to Tayouri (2015), humans are social beings with a strong
              need to communicate and have relationships, it’s all part of the
              human nature. People always lived in groups and sometimes communicated
              around a fire, city markets, coffee’ shops and pubs. In the modern
              era communication has been drastically changed, most of it is
              digitized: we can use Facebook to keep in touch with old friends,
              far away loved ones and family; we have Twitter for microblogging,
              where we can express our opinions about politicians and famous people
              without being scared of repercussions; whatsapp is our most used
              instant messaging application for communicating to our loved ones,
              work and study colleagues; Instagram and Youtube are our favourite
              platforms for following material related to our hobbies and interests.</p>

            <p>Using social media we have access to a lot of people and new ways
              for interaction, people share their experiences, support friends
              and get market informations.
            One problem of using social media is the common over-sharing of
            personal information which on a long run might cause negative
            consequences, such as sharing one’s location on a social platform or
            allowing messages between social networks without considering that
            these platforms are also used by criminals with malicious intentions.
            With all the benefits social media brought to us a huge number of
            risks also came along. A major concern within information security
            is the threat of social engineering attacks (Metalidou E. et al.,
            2014). The major risks in using these networks are: insufficient
            authentication controls, information leakage, injection flaws,
            information integrity, and more. The most frequently used cyber-attack
            methods are: Spear Phishing and Web Application Attacks. Spear
            Phishing is an attack attempt a criminal launches trying to persuade
            someone in opening an infected file or to click on a link, if the
            user of the program or email falls in this trap he might get attacked
            and share personal information without any awareness.
            There are several methods for mitigating social media security risks.</p>

            <p>Many companies nowadays use a formal policy to guide their
              employees on the use of social media. These policies are guidelines
              for the users so that they know what is acceptable behaviour and
               what is unacceptable on social media, they might also guide the
               user through choosing an appropriate password and what information
               they can and cannot share. In many cases the only knowledge that a
               policy exists might not be enough to train an employee in a real
               life situation, for these situations there’s need for education,
               training and technology.</p>

            <h2>Humans are the weak link</h2>

            <p>The first step towards strengthening the weak link that is the
              human factor is education. Nowadays the internet is accessible to
              a large number of people, many children start using applications
              before they even go to school through gaming and online learning.
              Internet can be a very risky resource for children, reasons can be
              cyber-bullying, pedophilia and accessing adult websites. A report
              by IBM released on 2014 attributes some 95% of IT security breaches
              to human error. For these reasons education on how to use the
              internet and protect personal information should be teached in the
              earliest years of school though. During high school this education
              should be taken to the next level, teaching the youth more advanced
              concepts. The
            training can improve the online risks awareness in order to not commit
            actions that might lead to data and malware breaches. The training
            provided by companies should provide qualitative explanations about
            the acceptable use of social media and security policy, give examples
            of cyber-attacks and reporting incidents (Tayouri D., 2015).M</p>

            <p>A new approach in training employees on the newest and advanced
              security procedures is the use of video games, because many other
              methods don’t require the users to think about the applied procedures.
              According to Ben-Asher et al. (2015), during a simplified Intrusion
              Detection System (IDS) simulation, responses from participants that
              have knowledge in cyber security indicated that they were able to
              distinguish between different types of cyber-attacks, whereas novice
              participants were not sensitive to the attack types.</p>

            <p>The interactivity of a videogame can help the users to learn the
              concepts faster with a constant rate of improvement, the effectiveness
              of these training sessions should be assessed. A good assessment
              method could be the employment of drills, social engineering simulations
              on the employees to see if they detect the cyber-attack and if
              they report it to procedure (Tayouri D., 2015).</p>

            <h2>Technology</h2>

            <p>Another important aspect for mitigating the human error is technology,
              giving our best in this area means helping people to protect
              themselves better against cyber-attacks. In a social engineering
              scam it’s important to gather data about the the victim, therefore
              limiting unknown people from having information about them through
              privacy settings is crucial. Cyber-security is an accepted part of
              business life and organisations invest heavily in people, resources
              and budget (Green J., 2015).</p>

            <p>Companies should ensure that employees always use devices with
              updated firewalls,
            antiviruses and anti-malware. It’s very important that employees know
            how to use protection software and scan regularly their devices,
            including flash-drives and downloaded material. A huge risk in using
            social media is fake identities, it’s hard to know who to trust when
            it comes from accepting friendship requests. Filtering friendship
            requests with the use of technology that checks the reliability of
            one’s profile and does cross-checks against other databases and users
            references can help by not letting user fall into malicious traps.</p>

            <p>Threats can also be detected by using social media itself, if an
              employee seems to have a bad working relationship with it’s boss and
              company, if it appears to have a narcissistic behaviour or simply
              being a very frustrated person, this might lead the person to leak
              information that an be used to harm the company.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>The way we communicate has been changed in the modern digital era.
            Social media became what we use to share our feelings and thoughts to
            the rest of the world, but it has a lot of security threats.
            To strengthen the human behaviour towards a more secure use of the
            internet and social
            media education must start in the earliest years of school and then
            continue during corporate employment. Sometimes uncommon methods towards
            education, such as interactive video-games can be more efficient
            than traditional education. Simulating cyber-attacks on the employees
            is an efficient way of establishing if the training was successful.
            Education by itself is not enough to ensure improvement, technology
            is needed. Enforcing privacy settings, using monitoring tools and using
            social media is an efficient way of protecting data. The combination
            of technology, training and education might be the best way to mitigate
            corporate information and reduce data leakage.</p>

            <p>After a long research on the topic and on how to actually write a
              literature review, this is my final product for the first coursework
              of this teaching block in Web Foundations 1. We submitted our works in
              two different phases, the first getting peer reviews/advice and a
              second where we actually got graded. We've been asked not to waste time
              on formatting it too much because we'd have to do it on mark-up and
              CSS in the second coursework.</p>
